### Mini Projects

#### 1️ [Customer Segmentation Analysis](./mini-projects/01-customer-segmentation/)
**Topics**: Clustering, PCA, Feature Engineering, RFM Analysis  
**Description**: Segmented 4,338 customers into distinct groups using K-Means clustering based on purchasing behavior.  
**Key Skills**: Data preprocessing, unsupervised learning, business analytics  
**Tools**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, plotly

**Results**:
- Identified 4 customer segments with 85%+ classification accuracy
- Generated actionable business recommendations
- Created interactive visualizations for stakeholder presentation
