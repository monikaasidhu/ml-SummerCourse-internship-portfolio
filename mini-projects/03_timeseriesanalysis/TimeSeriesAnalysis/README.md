## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mercuryafk/TimeSeriesAnalysis.git
    cd TimeSeriesAnalysis
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 How to Run

This project uses a two-step workflow to ensure the dashboard is fast.

1.  **Run the offline computation script first**: This will train all the models and generate the forecast CSV files. This step is slow and only needs to be run once.
    ```bash
    python runmodelsoffline.py
    ```

2.  **Run the Streamlit dashboard**: This will start the web app, which loads the pre-computed data. This step is fast.
    ```bash
    streamlit run dashboard.py
    ```

## 💡 Model Findings & Comparison

This project's core is the comparison of different modeling approaches. Each model revealed different strengths and weaknesses.

| Model | Key Characteristics | Performance Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ARIMA** | Statistical baseline, models autocorrelation. | Produced a stable, linear forecast. Serves as a great benchmark but misses non-linear patterns. |
| **SARIMA** | Extends ARIMA with seasonal components. | Forecast was similar to ARIMA, indicating weak quarterly seasonality in the stock data. Computationally expensive. |
| **Prophet** | Automated, decomposable model. | Excellent for providing insights into yearly and weekly patterns, but the overall forecast was similar to the trend. |
| **LSTM** | Deep learning neural network. | **Most accurate model in back-testing (RMSE ≈ $6.71)**. Excelled at capturing complex, non-linear price movements. Long-range forecasts were unstable, highlighting its limitation. |

### Conclusion
The **LSTM** model provided the most accurate short-term predictions on unseen test data. However, **Prophet** was invaluable for its ability to decompose the time series and provide human-readable insights. The choice of the "best" model depends on the specific goal: raw accuracy (LSTM) vs. interpretability (Prophet).

## File Caricature

This repository has multiple files, let me outline what each of them does and why I have included them here:

1. **aapldataprep.py** - This file includes code that we used to get and then prep the aapl stock data from 2015 to 2025. The code allowed us to extract everything, cleaned up in - 'apple_stock_data.csv'.                                                         
2. **afdtest.py** - This code is where we tested if the data was stationary or not. Which is crucial for time series models. The test failed, as expected.
3. **makestationary.py** - This code is where we processed the data to make it stationary, which was crucial for training our models.
4. **runmodelsoffline.py** - This is where we train all our models, and save the CSVs from. This code is where all the csv files in the repo came from. This code takes 'apple_stock_data.csv' and then trains all the models on it one by one. Starting from ARIMA, to LSTM. Once the data is generated, it is then saved into CSVs. This was a necessary step as SARIMA and LSTM were computationally very expensive and it took sarima over 15 minutes to load locally. Having the results precomputed saves a lot of time and helps load the frontend fast and efficiently.
   

    - ***arima_forecast.csv*** - Saved all the arima model's data here, the forecast and everything.
    - ***sarima_forecast.csv*** - Saved sarima's data and forecast here.
    - ***prophet_forecast.csv*** - Prophet's data and forecast here.
    - ***lstm_forecast.csv*** - This is where the LSTM model's predication on original data was stored.
    - ***lstm_future_forecast.csv*** - This is where the prediction of 3 months in the future was forecasted by our previously trained LSTM model.
5. **dashboard.py** - This is the code for the frontend of our dashboard, a streamlit based interface which uses the precomputed data in the CSVs mentioned above and simply plot them quickly for end users to study. 

That was that! First ever project where I tinkered around with ML and other such fascinating tools.
