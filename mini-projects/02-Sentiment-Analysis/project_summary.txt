 KEY INSIGHTS:
================================================================================

1. DATA INSIGHTS:
   • Balanced dataset with equal positive/negative reviews
   • Average review length: ~233 words
   • Reviews range from very short to extremely detailed

2. MODEL COMPARISONS:
   • Traditional ML (Logistic Regression):
     - Fastest training and inference
     - Highly interpretable (can see important words)
     - Good baseline performance (~88% accuracy)
     - Best for: Production systems requiring speed
   
   • Deep Learning (LSTM):
     - Better at capturing context and nuances
     - Improved accuracy (~89%)
     - Requires more computational resources
     - Best for: Complex sentiment patterns
   
   • Transformer (BERT):
     - State-of-the-art performance
     - Pre-trained knowledge transfer
     - Highest resource requirements
     - Best for: Maximum accuracy when resources available

3. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS:
   • Movie review aggregation platforms
   • Social media monitoring
   • Customer feedback analysis
   • Product review classification
   • Brand sentiment tracking

4. DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS:
   • Logistic Regression: Production-ready, scalable
   • LSTM: Good balance of performance and speed
   • BERT: Best accuracy but requires GPU for real-time inference
